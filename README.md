# SuiRepute

SuiRepute a simple yet robust solution for scoring users on the Sui blockchain. The approach is to use a reputation system built on top of 
a set of smart contracts (modules). This will enable dapps to create, manage, and assign scores to users based on their actions and interactions
within the system.

Here's a high-level overview of how such a system could work:

1- A set of smart contracts (modules) on the Sui blockchain that manages the reputation scores.
2- Define specific actions and interactions that can affect a user's reputation score (e.g., successful transactions, contributions to the community, etc.).
3- Update the reputation scores of users within the smart contract based on their actions and interactions.

Allow users to query their reputation scores and rankings within the system.
