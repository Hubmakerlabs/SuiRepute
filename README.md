# SuiRepute

SuiRepute a simple yet robust solution for scoring users on the Sui blockchain. The approach is to use a reputation system built on top of 
a set of smart contracts (modules). This will enable dapps to create, manage, and assign scores to users based on their actions and interactions
within the system.

Here's a high-level overview of the system:

1- A set of smart contracts (modules) on the Sui blockchain that manages the reputation scores.

2- Specifications for certain actions and interactions that can affect a user's reputation score (e.g., successful transactions, contributions to the community, etc.).

3- Updates the reputation scores of users within the smart contract based on their actions and interactions on the network.


4- Allow users to query their reputation scores and rankings within the system.
